Project(HTML,CSS,JS): Creating a quiz from scratch to help friend practice for driving exam.

This is my first time creating something practical with my programming knowledge.
A friend needed help studying for a driving exam so I figured I can build a quiz that can be accessed online from her phone.
But unlike other quizzes out there, this one will be unique to her.
The quiz will specifically hold all the questions she has gotten wrong when practicing.
There would be no need to test her on questions she has gotten right already.
So, this would be the pre-test to make sure she has learned.
