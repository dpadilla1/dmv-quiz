Project(HTML,CSS,JS): Creating a quiz from scratch to help friend practice for driving exam.

Notes:
-First-time experience with jQuery.
-Mobile-Browser Focused. Not scaled great with PC Browsers.

History:
This is my first time creating something practical with my programming knowledge.
A friend needed help studying for a driving exam so I figured I can build a quiz that can be accessed online from her phone.

Future Goals:
-Make program scalable for PC Browsers.
-Add enough questions to have random quiz everytime.
